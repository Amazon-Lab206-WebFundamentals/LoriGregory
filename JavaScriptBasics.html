        <p> JavaScript Basics</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language, JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser, or Node serve), it can be connected to the ojbects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.<p>

        <li><u>Variable Delcaration</u> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-image a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds the value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</li>
        <li><u>Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>
        <li><u>Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean - true or false, null-null aka nothing; Number-42 or 3.14159 String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array-[1, 'Coding', 'Dojo']; and Ojbect - {first_name: 'Jane', lawt_name:'Doe'}
        <li><u>Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specific a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
        <li><u>Loops</u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thinkg: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you ahve to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. thats a loop!</li>
        <li><u>Function</u> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. as an example imagine we re putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li></class>
